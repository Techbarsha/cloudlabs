### **Question 1:**  
**Why do we need to have different considerations around latency from voice channels to chat channels?**  

ðŸŸ¢ **Options:**  
1. ðŸŸ¢ **In voice channels, it is not possible to use UI elements to illustrate a delay in the answer, making it seem like the call might have a problem.**  
2. âšª **Chat channels are more prone to delays.**  
3. âšª **Not needed to have different considerations since the webhook behavior is the same.**  
4. âšª **Because customers using chat channels are more keen to drop the session in case of delays vs in the voice channel.**
