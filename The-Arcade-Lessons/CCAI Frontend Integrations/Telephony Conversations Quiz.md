2. 🟢 **Session parameters**  
3. ⚪ **End of speech detection**  
4. ⚪ **Start of speech detection**  
5. 🟢 **The caller’s audio stream**  
6. 🟢 **Programmatic events that change the conversation state**

### **Question 2:**  
**Which of the following are returned from the CCAI APIs through the telephony integration’s gRPC?** *(Choose three)*  

🟢 **Options:**  
1. ⚪ **The caller’s geolocation**  
2. 🟢 **Programmatic events that change the conversation state**  
3. 🟢 **Session parameters**  
4. 🟢 **Start of speech detection**  
5. ⚪ **The Caller’s IP Address**  
6. ⚪ **The caller’s audio stream**

### **Question 3:**  
**Which of the following features could help reliably authenticate users to your virtual agent?** *(Choose three)*  

🟢 **Options:**  
1. 🟢 **I can cross-reference Caller ID with a DTMF-collected pin code**  
2. ⚪ **Speaker ID tells me which one of my many enrolled users is speaking**  
3. 🟢 **I can lookup known users from Caller ID then use Speaker ID to tell me which one is speaking**  
4. 🟢 **I can use a regexp entity and collect an alpha/numeric ID with required form-filling**  
5. ⚪ **I can use a regexp entity and collect an alpha/numeric ID by annotating the entity in intent training phrases.**

### **Question 4:**  
**Google support asks you to share an audio recording of a problem behavior you’ve reported with your telephony experience. Which of the following considerations should you take?** *(Choose two)*  

🟢 **Options:**  
1. ⚪ **Encode as MP3 files so they can be shared with support more easily**  
2. 🟢 **Check that the caller and agent audio are in separate files, or separate channels of a stereo audio.**  
3. 🟢 **Record calls from your CCAI contact center solution.**  
4. ⚪ **Record your call from an app on your phone to get the original audio source.**  
5. ⚪ **Test in the Dialogflow console and record your screen and mic.**

### **Question 5:**  
**When you test your virtual agent through your telephony integration, you experience long periods of silence before hearing a response to your inputs. How might you fix this?** *(Choose four)*  

🟢 **Options:**  
1. ⚪ **Enable advanced timeout-based endpointing and decrease the sensitivity slider.**  
2. 🟢 **Enable advanced timeout-based endpointing and increase the sensitivity slider.**  
3. 🟢 **Specify a different speech model.**  
4. 🟢 **Check the performance of my fulfillments’ webhooks.**  
5. ⚪ **My integration offers an option to specify the maximum number of seconds to wait after a user speaks.**  
6. 🟢 **Contact my integration owner for troubleshooting any networking or other processing issues.**  

---

### **Question 6:**  
**Built-in Dialogflow features like barge-in, speech adaptation, and partial responses ensure consistent experiences regardless of your integration method.**  

🟢 **Options:**  
1. 🟢 **False**  
2. ⚪ **True**  

---

### **Question 7:**  
**You need at least one conversation profile per:** *(Choose three)*  

🟢 **Options:**  
1. 🟢 **Dialogflow agent**  
2. ⚪ **Release version**  
3. 🟢 **Language**  
4. 🟢 **Unique Agent Assist feature combination**  
5. ⚪ **Human Agent**  
6. ⚪ **Session**  

---

### **Question 8:**  
**Your virtual agent has trouble understanding users. When you check Dialogflow conversation history, the transcripts do not match what the user said. How might you fix this?**  

🟢 **Options:**  
1. 🟢 **Configure a different Google speech model better suited for my use-case.**  
2. 🟢 **Ensure that I collect alpha/numeric sequences (like 12345678 or ABCD1234) through form-filling.**  
3. 🟢 **Enable call companions to offer users an alternative input method.**  
4. ⚪ **There’s nothing I can do without implementing my own speech recognition.**  
5. 🟢 **Check that auto speech adaptation is enabled, then make sure the agent’s training phrases and entities contain the phrases the users are actually saying.**  
6. ⚪ **Be patient. Google models will eventually adapt to my users’ speech and my use-case.**  
7. 🟢 **Specify manual speech adaptations for the phrases I want to transcribe correctly.**  

---

### **Question 9:**  
**Which of the following advanced speech settings is most impactful to the performance of your solution?**  

🟢 **Options:**  
1. ⚪ **End of speech sensitivity**  
2. ⚪ **Advanced timeout-based endpointing**  
3. ⚪ **Barge-in**  
4. 🟢 **Speech model**
